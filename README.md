# DaHoodScript

DaHoodScript is a repository of scripts for the Roblox game "Da Hood". This README is a starter guide — it explains the repository purpose, how to use the scripts, safety and legal notes, and contribution guidelines.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Scripts that modify or automate gameplay may violate Roblox's Terms of Service and can result in bans. Use everything in this repository at your own risk. This project is provided "as-is" for educational purposes. Do not use scripts to harass, harass others, or otherwise break platform rules.

## Overview
This repository contains Lua scripts intended to be used with Roblox environments. They may include utilities, examples, or automation pieces for learning how scripting and Lua-based features work inside Roblox experiences. If your copy includes specific scripts for exploits or third-party executors, be careful and ensure you understand the legal and community implications.

## Requirements
- A working knowledge of Lua and Roblox development concepts.
- A safe environment to test scripts (local/project place or testing server).
- If scripts are meant to run with a third-party executor, follow that tool's documentation. This repository does not ship or endorse any particular executor.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   - git clone https://github.com/Cosmic4796/DaHoodScript.git
2. Inspect the scripts (do not run untrusted code).
3. Place or run the scripts according to your testing environment (Roblox Studio / executor / development tools).

## Usage
- Read each script top-to-bottom before running.
- Many scripts contain comments showing configuration options and usage examples.
- Example (local testing):
  - Open Roblox Studio, create a local script, and paste the code you inspected (only for code designed to run in Studio).
  - For runtime/executor usage, follow the executor's instructions for loading a script.

## File structure (example)
This README was created without a full repository listing. Typical layout might be:
- /scripts/         — Lua scripts and examples
- /docs/            — Additional documentation or how-tos
- README.md         — This file
- LICENSE           — Project license

If you want, I can inspect the repository and generate an accurate file tree and update this section.

## Configuration
- Many scripts will have simple variables at the top (e.g., toggles, target names, values).
- Edit configuration carefully and keep backups of original files before changing.

## Security & Responsible Use
- Never run code you don't trust.
- Do not use scripts to harm or harass other players or to bypass platform protections.
- Be aware of consequences: account action, bans, or legal issues.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested process:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your change.
3. Open a clear PR describing what you changed and why.
4. Keep changes focused and include tests or usage notes when appropriate.

Please include clear comments and documentation for any script you add.
